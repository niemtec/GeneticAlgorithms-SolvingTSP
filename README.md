This repository serves as a store of my approach to solving the [Travelling Salesperson Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) as part of "CS2004 Alogirhtms and their Applications" module at [Brunel University London](http://www.brunel.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/computer-science-bsc).

The aim of the project was to repreoduce a series of solutions to the TSP from the field of heuristic and genetic algorithms.
The project consists of a large dataset which represents the matrix of distances between all cities for a particular size of problem.

The following solutions are utilised in this approach:
* Random Mutation Hill Climbing (RMHC)
* Random Restart Hill Climbing (RRHC)
* Stochastic Hill Climbing (SHC)
* Simulated Annealing (SA)

Each of the approaches was applied to a problem space of varying size, the experiments were ran multiple times to remove operational outliers and provie an average performance for each of the solutions. 
Documentation of findings can be found in the corresponding .xls file or the report.
